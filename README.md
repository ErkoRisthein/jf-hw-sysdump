Java Fundamentals - I/O Homework
===========

Description
----------

Your task is to write a Java program which packs and unpacks files without compression. Implement the following interface

```
public interface Packer {
  void pack(Path inputDir, Path outputArchive) throws IOException;
  void unpack(Path inputArchive, Path outputDir) throws IOException;
}
```

The project has a set of unit tests. To get the maximum points all those tests must pass. Existing tests cannot be altered.

Requirements
----------

1. Support both relative and absolute paths.
2. Support directories recursively.
3. Create missing parent directories automatically.
4. Only pack files (no support for empty directories).
5. Use DataInputSteam and DataOutputStream.
6. Support big files that don’t fit into memory at once.
7. Buffer data for better performance.
8. Close all resources properly.

File Format of the Archive
----------

* Whole Archive = Archive Type + File Chunk(1) + File Chunk(2) + … + File Chunk(n)
* Archive Type = 42 (1 fixed byte)
* File Chunk = File Path + File Length + File Contents
* File Path – bytes of a String of a relative path in the archive separated by / characters (use readUTF()/writeUTF() methods)
* File Length – 8 bytes showing how many bytes does the File Contents take (big endian long)
* File Contents – actual file in the archive
